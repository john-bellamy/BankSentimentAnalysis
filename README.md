# About
I love analyzing text. This is my bread-and-butter and what I really concentrated on through much of my education and career. Text is more challenging to work with than numbers and it takes a particular skillset. When I was thinking of what data I could use for a sentiment analysis dashbaord the idea of banks came to me. So, I searched Twitter for tweets containing the name of three big American banks. The resulting data is later visualized in Tableau. 

# How to use:
Run through the Bank Sentiment Cleaning and then run Bank Sentiment Analysis.
